# Surfs_Up_Analysis
## Project Overview 
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.
## Results
### June Temp Analysis
From the image of the dataframe below, here is what I see:
- Max temp is 85 degress F
- Min temp is 64 degrees F
- Total of temperature data points is 1700
- Average temperature is 75 degrees F

### December Temp Analysis
From the image of the dataframe below, here is what I see:
- Max temp is 83 degress F
- Min temp is 56 degrees F
- Total of temperature data points is 1517
- Average temperature is 71 degrees F

### Comparison Analysis
- Average temperature is about the same
- Maximum temperature is close to the same
- The low in December is quit a bit lower than June

## Summary
- Check out other weather factors besides temperature such as rain
- Look into other activities going on during that month that would bring people into the ice cream shop
