# Surfs_Up_Analysis
## Project Overview 
Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you’ll filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June. You’ll then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.
## Results

From the image of the dataframe below, here is what I see:
- Max temp is 85 degress F
- Min temp is 64 degrees F
- Total of temperature data points is 1700
- Average temperature is 75 degrees F
